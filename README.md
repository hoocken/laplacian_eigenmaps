# Laplacian Eigenmaps

Thanks to the astroML database to provide SDSS galaxy spectra database, and for https://github.com/stephenportillo/SDSS-VAE/blob/master/SDSS-VAE.ipynb, from which the code of the dataset for the galaxy spectra was mostly adapted.

Run if using a local conda environment:
```
conda install --file code/requirements.txt
